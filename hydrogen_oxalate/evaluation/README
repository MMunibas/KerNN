In addition to the scripts that were described for h2co, here we add an
optimization script (optimize_crit_fine.py) which can also be used to
optimize TS (once the initial guess is in vicinity of the TS). Additionally,
the script NN_NM.py uses the models Hessian to calculate the harmonic 
frequencies.
